Each CV page includes:
- Essential SEO meta tags for better search engine visibility.
- Open Graph (OG) tags to enhance social media sharing.

### Favicon

A favicon is included in the head section of each HTML file for a consistent branding experience.

## Instructions

1. **Create HTML Files:** Develop separate HTML files for each job title, focusing on relevant skills and experiences.
2. **Update Links:** Ensure all links in the main CV hub page (`cv-hub.html`) correctly point to the individual CV pages.
3. **Favicon:** Place a `favicon.ico` file in the same directory as your HTML files.
4. **Open Graph Tags:** Replace placeholder URLs in the OG tags with actual website and image URLs.
